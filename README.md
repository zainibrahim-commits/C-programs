# C-programs
This c programs are for learning and any one can contribute.

##Good Programming Practices:-
1.Every function should be preceded by a comment describing the purpose of the function.
2.Add a comment to the line containing the right brace,},that closes every function,including main.
3.Indent the entire body of each function one level of indentation (we recommend three spaces) within the braces that define the body of the function.This indentation emphasizes the functional structure of programs and helps make programs easier to read.
4.Set a convention for the size of indent you prefer and then uniformly apply that convention.The tab key may be used to create indents,but tab stops may vary.
4.Choosing meaningful variable names helps make a program self-documenting that is,fewer comments are needed.
5.The first letter of an identifier used as a simple variable name should be a lowercase letter. Later in the text weâ€™ll assign special significance to identifiers that begin with a capital letter and to identifiers that use all capital letters.
6.Multiple-word variable names can help make a program more readable. Separate the words with underscores as in total-commissions, or, if you run the words together, begin each word after the first with a capital letter as in totalCommissions. The latter style is preferred.
7.Place a space after each comma (,) to make programs more readable.
8.Place spaces on either side of a binary operator. This makes the operator stand out and makes the program more readable.
9.Indent both body statements of an if...else statement.
10.If there are several levels of indentation, each level should be indented the same additional amount of space.
11.A compound statement can be placed anywhere in a program that a single statement can be placed.
12.When performing division by an expression whose value could be zero, explicitly test for this case and handle it appropriately in your program (such as printing an error message) rather than allowing the fatal error to occur.
13.In a sentinel-controlled loop, the prompts requesting data entry should explicitly remind the user what the sentinel value is.
14.Unary operators should be placed directly next to their operands with no intervening spaces.
15.Too many levels of nesting can make a program difficult to understand. As a rule, try to avoid using more than three levels of nesting.
16.The combination of vertical spacing before and after control statements and indentation of the bodies of control statements within the control-statement headers gives programs a two-dimensional appearance that greatly improves program readability.
